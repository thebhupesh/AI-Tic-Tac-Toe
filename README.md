# AI-Tic-Tac-Toe
AI Tic-Tac-Toe is a project with objective to reduce the time complexity of finding an optimal move in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe by minimizing the use of Minimax Algorithm to find an optimal move in a Tic-Tac-Toe game. It uses general tree structure to store the moves played once and uses it in case of similar moves and reduces the use of Minimax and hence reducing the runtime of whole project.
